# ruby-private-method-extract

Experimental project to extract private methods out of longer existing methods.

* Creates a private section of the class if one doesn't exist.
* Takes a visual selection and names the method after the local variable before the equals sign.
* Makes the statement following the equals sign the method body.
* Trims whitespace and fixes indentation after call.

This project is an initial effort in learning Vimscript. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are very welcome.
